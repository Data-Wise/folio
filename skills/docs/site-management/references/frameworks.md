# Documentation Framework Comparison

Choosing between MkDocs, Quarto, and pkgdown for your project.

## Quick Decision Guide

**R Package?**
→ pkgdown (standard) or Quarto (modern alternative)

**Python/Node/DevTools?**
→ MkDocs (recommended)

**Academic/Research?**
→ Quarto (supports R, Python, Julia)

**Need speed?**
→ MkDocs (fastest setup)

---

## Framework Comparison

| Feature | MkDocs | Quarto | pkgdown |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Best for** | Dev tools, Python, Node | Research, multi-language | R packages |
| **Setup time** | 2 minutes | 5 minutes | 3 minutes |
| **Language** | Python | R/Python/Julia | R only |
| **Theme** | Material (beautiful) | Bootstrap | Bootstrap |
| **Code execution** | No | Yes (R, Python) | Yes (R vignettes) |
| **GitHub Pages** | Easy | Easy | Built-in |
| **Learning curve** | Low | Medium | Low |
| **Flexibility** | High | Very high | Medium |

- Multi-language projects
- When you need code execution

**Setup:**

```bash
# Create _quarto.yml manually
/site:init              # Detects Quarto
/site:preview           # Preview
/site:deploy            # Deploy
```

**Manual init example:**

```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site

website:
  title: "My Project"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
```

## pkgdown

**What it is:**

- R package documentation builder
- Standard for R packages
- Automatically generates from R code

**Pros:**
✅ Standard for R packages
✅ Auto-generates from R docs
✅ R community standard
✅ Vignette integration
✅ Function reference auto-generated

**Cons:**
❌ R packages only
❌ Less flexible than others
❌ Bootstrap theme (older style)
❌ Requires R environment

**Best for:**

- R packages (obvious choice)
- When you want R standard approach

**Setup:**

```r
# In R console
usethis::use_pkgdown()
pkgdown::build_site()
```

**Commands:**

- Use `/site:init` (detects R package)
- Or use R directly

## Feature Comparison

### Code Execution

**MkDocs:** ❌ No

- Markdown only
- Show code examples, but don't run them

**Quarto:** ✅ Yes

- Execute R, Python, Julia
- Show code + output
- Reproducible documents

**pkgdown:** ✅ Yes (R only)

- Vignettes executed
- Examples run and tested

### Themes

**MkDocs:**

```

**Quarto:**

```bash
/site:deploy            # Automated
```

**pkgdown:**

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
# Then push _site/ to gh-pages
```

## Migration Between Frameworks

### MkDocs → Quarto

- Rename `docs/` → `*.qmd` files
- Create `_quarto.yml`
- Add code chunks if needed

### Quarto → MkDocs

- Convert `*.qmd` → `*.md`
- Remove code execution chunks
- Create `mkdocs.yml`

### pkgdown → Quarto

- Keep R package structure
- Add `_quarto.yml`
- Convert vignettes to Quarto
- Use `altdoc` package for integration

---

## Recommendations by Project Type

### R Package

**1st choice:** pkgdown

- Standard, expected by R users
- Auto-generates from R docs
- `/site:init` detects automatically

**Alternative:** Quarto + altdoc

- Modern approach
- More flexibility
- Good for research-heavy packages

### Python Package

**1st choice:** MkDocs

- Python ecosystem standard
- Beautiful Material theme
- `/site:mkdocs:init` for quick setup

### Node.js / Dev Tools

**1st choice:** MkDocs

- Fast setup
- Great for developer tools
- `/site:mkdocs:init`

### Research / Academic

**1st choice:** Quarto

## Our Command Structure

**Generic (auto-detect):**

```bash
/site:init         # Detects best framework
/site:preview      # Preview any framework
/site:deploy       # Deploy any framework
```

**MkDocs-specific (fast, no questions):**

```bash
/site:mkdocs:init      # Force MkDocs
/site:mkdocs:preview   # Quick preview
/site:mkdocs:status    # Status check
```

**Why both?**

- Generic commands: Flexibility, auto-detection
- MkDocs commands: Speed, opinionated (ADHD-friendly)
